# pykbi

## Python module to work on radial distribution functions and Kirkwood-Buff integrals

Kirkwood-Buff theory bridges microscopic structure and macroscopic properties
of isotropic liquids. The classical theory deals with open and infinite systems, while the 
new correction allows us to work on closed and finite systems. The code contains modules to correct finite-size 
effects in Radial Distribution functions (RDFs) from Molecular Simulations, and integrate RDFs obtained from 
both open and closed ensembles.
